Choose your route carefully while selecting a room to enter, as you cannot go back and head to another room. Each Labyrinth has three tiers. Having completed the tier, Heroes have an opportunity to set up a camp to have some rest. A camp serves as a checkpoint - next time you enter the Labyrinth, you will have to start at the last camp you have reached. Blessings obtained in the previous tiers are retained. Players can restore some HP, resurrect Heroes fallen in a battle against evil, and acquire and upgrade blessings. The level of difficulty of each tier rises gradually.
